# Rainfall-Prediction
Rainfall prediction is helpful to avoid many disasters. Rainfall is a climatic factor that affects many human activities like agriculture, production, and forestry. Predicting the rainfall before itself helps in the prevention of the losses.
The dataset
consisting of various climatic attributes was sourced from Kaggle spanning 2008-
2018. The existing system includes the following techniques Random Forest, KNearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Ensemble AdaBoost
which yielded an accuracy of 88% ,87% ,84% ,70% and 85% respectively. In the 
proposed system we used machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,
Light GBM, CatBoost and XGBoost. The accuracy obtained after performing these
techniques are79%, 87% ,94.7% and 94% respectively. The performance of the
algorithms are examined based on Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, Time
Taken for Execution, Area under ROC, Support and Cohen’s Kappa. The prediction
models developed are compared to one another to display the best algorithm. The
first comparison is done based on Accuracy and Time Taken for Execution and 
based on Area under ROC and Cohen’s Kappa. After the performance analysis 
XGBoost is said to have high performance compared to other models whereas
Logistic Regression has less performance.
